Through code, I can generate ideas that solve user-specific problems, design and ideate possible solutions, and then execute them. Ultimately, engaging in this end-to-end experience is fulfilling to me because I get to not only imagine an experience but also bring it to fruition.\n--\nQuestion: Why are you interested in applying for kickboxing club?\nAnswer:Throughout my time of being a black belt, I have noticed many changes that have occurred since becoming one. Many changes are minor, like different classes, practicing more, and learning more curriculum. Being a black belt has a stronger impact on a person than most belts. It teaches a person, including myself, a lot more of how amazing one person can be. During my journey to become a  junior black belt, I didnâ€™t realize how much work and effort went into becoming one."
